The Capstone/Porfolio project is one in which I am trying to predict the price of selling used cars.

The data was obtained from kaggle:
100K UK Used Car - Price Prediction Model [0.95+] Python Â· 100,000 UK Used Car Data set https://www.kaggle.com/code/loicrouillermonay/100k-uk-used-car-price-prediction-model-0-95/notebook

# Overview:

#### 1. Goal is to predict current car prices of a vehicle provided the Make & Model is one of the 11 we have used in dataset.  

#### 2. To achieve that, load dataset (99,000 +) records from kaggle.

#### 3. Processing steps
#####    a. Load data into dataframe,
#####    b. Data cleansing
#####    c. Feature Engineering (Try to reduce Features used, and encode Categorical data
#####    d. Determine which Regression algorithm will best work with data to produce model
#####    e. Evaluate models to determine best performing on test data
#####    f. Hyperparameter tuning to improve chances of better performance
